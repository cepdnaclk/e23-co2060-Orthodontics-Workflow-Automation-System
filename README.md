# Orthodontics Workflow Automation System (OWAS)

The **Orthodontics Workflow Automation System (OWAS)** is a web-based clinical management platform designed to modernize dental clinic operations by replacing manual, paper-based record-keeping. The system centralizes patient history, diagnostic images, and clinical notes into a secure digital hub, enabling healthcare providers to retrieve records instantly and improve the speed of patient care.

Built with a modular and scalable architecture, OWAS is designed for future-readiness, allowing the system to expand and integrate with other clinical units across the Dental Hospital. This project aims to improve operational efficiency and diagnostic accuracy by bridging the gap between traditional clinical practices and modern health informatics.
